When people use search engines, their language tends to differ significantly from natural language communication. Instead of forming complete sentences or questions as they would in a conversation, users often input a series of relevant terms or short phrases to optimize search results. For instance, someone looking for information on baking a cake might type &quot;easy cake recipe&quot; rather than asking, &quot;How do I bake a cake easily?&quot; This behavior stems from the need for efficiency and the way search engines process queries, where specific keywords yield better results. Over time, this search-specific language has become second nature to users, who intuitively know how to phrase their queries to quickly find the information they seek.

Large language models (LLMs) can significantly transform the search landscape by bridging the gap between natural language and search engine queries. LLMs can interpret and respond to full sentences and complex questions as effectively as keyword-based queries. This allows users to interact with search engines in a more conversational manner, similar to how they would communicate with another person. As these models become more integrated into search technologies, they could shift user behavior back towards natural language communication, reducing the need for keyword-based searching.
