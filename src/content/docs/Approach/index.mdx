To achieve real-time keyword extraction using natural language, we plan to fine-tune our large language model (LLM) to handle dual tasks: extracting keywords and parameters for internal use and interacting seamlessly with users. This approach will involve sophisticated fine-tuning techniques to ensure our LLM can effectively parse natural language inputs and provide relevant, structured data for our systems.
