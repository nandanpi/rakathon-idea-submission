Once the LLM has extracted the relevant keywords and parameters from the user&#x27;s input, these data points will be used to perform a database search. Our system will query an extensive product database, filtering results based on the extracted parameters such as brand, price range, delivery time, RAM, and storage requirements. This process ensures that the search results are highly relevant to the user&#x27;s needs, providing a more efficient and accurate retrieval of information. The structured data from the LLM enables our system to quickly identify the most suitable products, significantly improving the speed and precision of the search process.
