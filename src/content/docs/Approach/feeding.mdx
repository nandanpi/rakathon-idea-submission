After retrieving the search results from the database, the data will be fed back into the LLM. The LLM will then process this information to generate an interactive response for the user. This response will not only present the most relevant options but also allow the LLM to continue the conversation with the user. For instance, if the initial results do not fully meet the user&#x27;s criteria, the LLM can ask follow-up questions or refine the search parameters further. This iterative process ensures that the user receives the most accurate and satisfying results, making the search experience more dynamic and responsive.
