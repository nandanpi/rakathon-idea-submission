Our system will also support the creation of user profiles. By storing user preferences, search history, and frequently used parameters, we can offer a highly personalized search experience. When a user interacts with the system, the LLM will leverage this stored information while also updating it and adding new information. For example, if a user frequently searches for electronics within a specific price range, the LLM will prioritize these preferences in future searches. Additionally, the system can suggest new products based on past behavior and preferences, making the search process more efficient and user-friendly.
