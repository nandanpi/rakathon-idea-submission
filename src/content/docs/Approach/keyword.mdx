Our LLM will be fine-tuned to split its output into two distinct sections. The first section will be dedicated to extracting keywords and parameters such as brand, price range, and delivery time. For example, if a user asks, &quot;Can you find a smartphone under Rs. 30,000 with next-day delivery?&quot; our model will identify &quot;smartphone&quot; as the keyword and &quot;under Rs. 30,000&quot; and &quot;next-day delivery&quot; as key parameters. This extracted data will be formatted in a structured way to be processed by our internal systems, enabling them to perform precise and efficient searches.
