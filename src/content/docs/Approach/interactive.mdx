To enhance the user experience, our system will include features such as product comparison and summary of product reviews. Product comparison feature will allow users to compare different products side by side, presenting detailed information in a tabular format. Users will be able to see specifications such as price, brand, RAM, storage, delivery options, and more, all in one place. The LLM will guide users through this comparison, highlighting key differences and helping them make informed decisions.
