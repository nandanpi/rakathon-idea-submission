We plan to develop a search system that leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for real-time keyword extraction and natural language interaction, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of search results while providing a conversational and personalized user experience. This dual approach will bridge the gap between natural language communication and traditional keyword-based search queries, optimizing both user satisfaction and search performance.
