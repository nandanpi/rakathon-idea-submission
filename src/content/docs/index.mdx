Our project aims to revolutionize the search experience by integrating fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for real-time keyword extraction and natural language interaction. By allowing users to interact with search engines conversationally, our system bridges the gap between natural language and traditional keyword-based queries, enhancing both user satisfaction and search performance. Leveraging advanced fine-tuning techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), our LLMs can efficiently parse user inputs to extract relevant keywords and parameters for precise searches, while also maintaining a natural and engaging conversation with users. This dual approach not only optimizes search accuracy but also personalizes the user experience, making it more intuitive and effective.
